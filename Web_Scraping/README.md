# Web Scraping
Web Scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. 
The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.

Web Scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. 
There are many different ways to perform web scraping to obtain data from websites. These include using online services, particular API’s or even creating your code for web scraping from scratch. 
Many large websites like Google, Twitter, Facebook, StackOverflow, etc. have API’s that allow you to access their data in a structured format.
