## Voice Recorder

## 🔥 Do write these points 🔥

Expectation - The program should have the following:
- Install libraries (sounddevice or pyaudio)
- Import libraries
- The recording can be set for a given number of seconds or for arbitrary time (either is fine)
- The code should generate a “.wav” recording file
- The project should use virtual env and should contain requirements.txt file
- The project should be added on Github with a README.md file containing the steps to install and run the project.
- To submit the code - complete the git tutorial and push your code to GitHub and attach the link to the repository in the google classroom submission

Note - Complete the virtual environment module first and create this project inside a virtual environment. Don’t worry if you’re stuck in this project, we are anyway going to discuss this in live sessions.
